They based their story on a poll that asked people, \"Irrespective of whether you attend a place of worship or not, would you say you are a religious person, not a religious person or a convinced atheist?\" This type of question, which asks people to classify themselves in one way or another, is common in polling and generates categorical data. Let's take a look at the atheism survey and explore what's at play when making inference about population proportions using categorical data.\n",

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual telephone survey of 350,000 people in the United States collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The BRFSS identifies risk factors in the adult population and report emerging health trends. For example, respondents are asked about their diet and weekly physical activity, their HIV/AIDS status, possible tobacco use, and even their level of healthcare coverage. The [BRFSS website](https://www.openintro.org/redirect.php?go=cdc_data_brfss&referrer=data_set_page) contains a complete description of the survey, the questions that were asked, and even research results that have been derived from the data.\n",

    "This dataset is a random sample of 20,000 people from the BRFSS survey conducted in 2000. While there are over 200 questions or variables in this dataset, the one will we will use in this Notebok only includes 3 variables."
